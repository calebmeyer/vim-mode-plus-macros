# Macros for vim mode plus
This package is still under construction. It works for basic commands, and with multiple cursors, but not with searching using `/`.

## Install
`apm install vim-mode-plus-macros` at the command line, or `ctrl-,`, click on install, then type vim-mode-plus-macros and click install.

## Usage
`q` in normal mode to start recording a macro

`q` in normal mode while recording a macro to stop recording the macro

`@` to apply the macro

## Roadmap
- [x] a macro can be recorded
- [x] a macro can be replayed
- [x] macros can include typing in insert mode
- [x] indicate macro recording state to user
- [ ] macros can be saved to (and recalled from) the 26 letters (e.g. `qa` and `@a`)
- [ ] macros can be named and saved
- [ ] specs
